# TopCoder Problem Solutions

## What is it?

When I studied computer science at Duke University, we were assigned algorithmic problem sets each week. These problem sets included several challenges from TopCoder, which I have posted my solutions to in this repo. Each folder contains the prompt for the challenge it is named after, as well as the code I wrote as a solution. Thanks to the built-in tester on the Duke CS department's website, the code for each challenge was put through many test cases (for some challenges, even hundreds of test cases), and passed them all.
