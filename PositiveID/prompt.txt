You are investigating a robbery, and you are sure the robbery was committed by one of the suspects you have information on. Each element of suspects will contain a number of characteristics of that suspect in a comma separated list. For example, suppose we had the following list of suspects:
suspect 0: "blond,tall,skinny"
suspect 1: "short,skinny,blond,tattooed"
suspect 2: "scarred,bald"
You may assume that if a characteristic is not on the list for a suspect then that characteristic does not apply - so in this case we can be sure that suspect 0 is not "tattooed" or "bald" or anything else other than what's listed. Therefore, if we knew that the culprit was "tattooed", we would know for sure that suspect 1 is the guilty party. However, if we knew that the culprit was "skinny" and "blond" we would still be unsure whether suspect 0 or suspect 1 was the robber.
Return the maximum number of facts we could know such that the facts:

Are all consistent with at least one of the suspects.
Do not uniquely identify the culprit.
In the example above, the value is 2. We could know that the suspect is "skinny" and "blond" - but if we knew anything more than that about the culprit then we would be able to identify the culprit uniquely (or the facts would no longer be consistent with any of the suspects).
