It's time to get something to eat and I've come across a sandwich bar. Like most people, I prefer certain types of sandwiches. In fact, I keep a list of the types of sandwiches I like.
The sandwich bar has certain ingredients available. I will list the types of sandwiches I like in order of preference and buy the first sandwich the bar can make for me. In order for the bar to make a sandwich for me, it must include all of the ingredients I desire.

Given available, a list of Strings/ingredients the sandwich bar can use, and a orders, a list of Strings that represent the types of sandwiches I like, in order of preference (most preferred first), return the 0-based index of the sandwich I will buy. Each element of orders represents one type of sandwich I like as a space-separated list of ingredients in the sandwich. If the bar can make no sandwiches I like, return -1.
