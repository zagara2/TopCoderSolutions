This task is about the scoring in the first phase of the die-game Yahtzee, where five dice are used. The score is determined by the values on the upward die faces after a roll. The player gets to choose a value, and all dice that show the chosen value are considered active. The score is simply the sum of values on active dice.
Say, for instance, that a player ends up with the die faces showing 2, 2, 3, 5 and 4. Choosing the value two makes the dice showing 2 active and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 makes the one die showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.

The method has one parameter toss, a five-element integer list, where each element represents the upward face of a die. Return the maximum possible score with these values.
